# portfolio
A portfolio of assorted scripting, coding and documentation products I have done in both professional environments as well as personal projects

Included is a small sampling of various work I have created (some complete, some works in progress) that demonstrates my proficiency at skills such as documentation writing, BASIC/powershell scripting, Excel, database creation and administration, and website development (HTML5/CSS/Javascript).

Anything relating to previous employers has been redacted for privacy purposes. Because of this and other reasons, most of the code is not able to function to its fullest, if at all. Attempts might be made to set up test information in some cases. However, while I can attest to a complete lack of malicious code in this repository, always be cautious of running arbitrary code on devices you control. I do not take responsibility for any negative consequences caused by running any code provided in this repository on any devices.

Details and context are included in the readme for each folder.

Account Setup - a work related web based app containing HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Excel components
Daily Commute - a personal project comprised of HTML and Javascript
