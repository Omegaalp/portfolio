This folder contains examples of PowerShell scripts I have written to assist with various work related tasks.

InventorySweep in particular is a culmination of a few other scripts I had made and was intended as the base for setting up the proposed Inventory Database mentioned in the Documentation folder of this repository.

Please note I was not given many tools to accomplish the job requirements in particular previous employment environments and had to create my own with what was available in order to meet the demands placed on me. I would have much preferred to use an actual inventory management system instead of typing everything into an Excel sheet as was the process when I started there.
